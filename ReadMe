# Hybrid Geothermal Vertical Radiator Cooling Architecture
### For Mid-Scale AI Data Centers

This repository documents a hybrid cooling and energy-offset architecture
that integrates:

- Vertical radiator towers (60 ft target head)
- Building height thermal drop
- Geothermal assist loop
- Liquid rack cooling integration
- Rainwater capture (non-potable)
- Gravity-assisted flow optimization
- Farm + rooftop thermal mass options
- Carbon offset modeling
