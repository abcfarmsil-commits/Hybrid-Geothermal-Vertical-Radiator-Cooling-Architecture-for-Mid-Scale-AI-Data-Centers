# Hybrid Geothermal Vertical Radiator Cooling Architecture
### For Mid-Scale AI Data Centers

This repository documents a hybrid cooling and energy-offset architecture
that integrates:

- Vertical radiator towers (60 ft target head)
- Building height thermal drop
- Geothermal assist loop
- Liquid rack cooling integration
- Rainwater capture (non-potable)
- Gravity-assisted flow optimization
- Farm + rooftop thermal mass options
- Carbon offset modeling

## Baseline Engineering Assumptions (v0.1)

This concept is modeled around the following reference case:

- IT Load: 10 MW (mid-scale AI deployment)
- Cooling Mode: Dry-first vertical radiator tower with VFD fan assist
- Rack Loop: 40°C supply / 50°C return (warm-water compatible)
- Design Ambient: 35°C dry bulb
- Target Approach: 7–10°C above ambient at peak
- Coil Pressure Drop Target: ≤10 Pa (draft-assist viable)
- Not intended as full chiller replacement
- Intended as fan/runtime reduction + recirculation control layer
- Geothermal = assist loop, not sole rejection mechanism

All values subject to refinement based on partner engineering input.
