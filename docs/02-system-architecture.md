# System Architecture

## Target Deployment
- Mid-scale AI data centers
- 5–20 MW IT load
- Direct-to-chip or liquid rack cooling environments

## Core Architecture Components

1. Vertical Radiator Towers (60 ft effective head target)
2. Building Height Thermal Drop Integration
3. Geothermal Stabilization Loop
4. Secondary Closed Cooling Loop for Rack Integration
5. Rain + Greywater Non-Potable Storage
6. Gravity-Assisted Flow Optimization
7. Optional Rooftop Thermal Mass (Farm / Solar / Radiant)

## Design Principle

Use vertical distance as thermal head.
Use gravity as pressure assist.
Reduce chiller load before mechanical systems activate.
