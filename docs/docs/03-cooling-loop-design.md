# Cooling Loop Design

## Primary Loop (Data Hall Interface)

- Interfaces with liquid rack coolers
- Closed glycol-water mixture
- Heat captured at server racks

## Secondary Vertical Loop

- Routed vertically through the tower
- Radiator array (aluminum finned pipe)
- Passive + assisted convection cooling

## Geothermal Assist

- Ground loop for temperature stabilization
- Reduces delta-T spikes during peak loads

## Estimated Performance Targets

- 10–15°F passive temperature reduction before chillers
- 15–30% reduction in chiller runtime
- Target PUE improvement: 0.05 – 0.15
