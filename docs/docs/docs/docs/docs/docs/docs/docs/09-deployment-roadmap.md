# Deployment Roadmap
Hybrid Vertical Radiator + Geothermal Cooling System

---

## 1. Purpose

This document outlines:

- Phased deployment strategy
- Market entry sequencing
- Pilot structure
- Engineering validation steps
- Scaling model

Goal:

Move from concept → pilot → repeatable infrastructure product.

---

## 2. Deployment Philosophy

Do NOT target hyperscalers first.

Target:

- 5–20 MW AI facilities
- Colocation providers
- Edge AI campuses
- New builds not yet finalized
- Sites with available land or vertical head

Mid-scale first.
Prove performance.
Then scale.

---

## 3. Phase 1 – Engineering Validation

Duration: 3–6 months

Objectives:

- CFD modeling of 60 ft tower
- Heat rejection curve validation
- Climate-specific simulations
- Borefield thermal modeling
- Pumping loss analysis
- Seasonal performance projection

Deliverables:

- Performance whitepaper
- Modeled PUE impact
- Verified ΔT expectations
- Refined CAPEX model

No construction yet.

---

## 4. Phase 2 – Pilot Installation

Target Site:

5 MW facility or smaller AI cluster.

Deployment:

- Single tower module
- Partial geothermal array
- Hybrid integration with CDU facility loop
- Chiller remains primary fallback

Objectives:

- Measure real ΔT
- Measure chiller runtime reduction
- Validate pump efficiency
- Track seasonal variance

Minimum measurement period:
6–12 months.

---

## 5. Phase 3 – Optimization

After pilot:

- Adjust radiator fin density
- Optimize flow rates
- Tune control logic
- Refine adiabatic assist thresholds
- Improve pump staging algorithms

Output:

Version 2 system design.

---

## 6. Phase 4 – Standardization

Create:

- Modular tower kits
- Prebuilt pump skid assemblies
- Standardized geothermal design templates
- Control system firmware package
- Installation manuals

Move toward productized infrastructure.

---

## 7. Phase 5 – Regional Scaling

Target regions:

- Moderate climates (ASHRAE zones 3–6)
- Regions with energy incentives
- Areas with rising AI demand
- States with high electricity cost

Focus on markets where:

Cooling load reduction has highest ROI.

---

## 8. Financial Scaling Model

Revenue streams:

- Direct system sales
- Performance-based contracts
- Energy savings share model
- ESG-linked financing
- Carbon credit monetization

Optional:

Cooling-as-a-Service (CaaS) model.

---

## 9. Risk Management Plan

Technical Risk:
Mitigate with modeling + pilot.

Financial Risk:
Phase deployment, no oversizing.

Market Risk:
Target facilities already planning liquid cooling.

Permitting Risk:
Engage municipalities early for tower height approval.

---

## 10. Competitive Positioning Strategy

Position as:

"Layered Passive Thermal Infrastructure"

Not:
"Free energy"
Not:
"Chiller replacement"

Key messaging:

- Reduces compressor runtime
- Improves PUE
- Improves resilience
- Adds redundancy
- Uses building height as an asset

---

## 11. Timeline Example

Year 0:
Modeling + Design

Year 1:
Pilot deployment

Year 2:
Refinement + 3–5 installations

Year 3:
Regional scaling

Year 5:
Multi-site standardized deployment

---

## 12. Exit or Expansion Options

Long-term paths:

- License technology to cooling OEMs
- Partner with geothermal contractors
- Partner with AI colocation builders
- Spin off infrastructure division
- Integrate with farm + water systems (optional)

---

## 13. Key Success Metrics

- Verified ΔT reduction ≥ 8°F
- ≥ 20% compressor reduction
- PUE improvement ≥ 0.07
- Payback ≤ 4 years
- Zero rack contamination events
- Zero downtime attributable to system

---

## 14. Strategic Advantage

This system:

- Uses geometry intelligently
- Uses physics conservatively
- Adds redundancy instead of replacing systems
- Improves cooling without radical redesign

It is incremental infrastructure evolution.

---

## 15. Final Positioning

This architecture is not:

A speculative concept  
A perpetual motion claim  
A chiller elimination fantasy  

It is:

Measured engineering  
Applied strategically  
To one of the fastest-growing energy markets in the world.
