| Boreholes (30–80 wells typical) | $300k – $800k |
| HDPE piping | $80k – $200k |
| Manifolds + vault | $50k – $120k |
| Pump station | $60k – $150k |

Estimated Geothermal Subtotal:
$500k – $1.2M

---

### 2.3 Plumbing + Integration

| Component | Estimated Range |
|------------|----------------|
| Plate heat exchangers | $60k – $180k |
| Facility loop rework | $100k – $300k |
| Insulated risers | $80k – $250k |
| Installation labor | $150k – $400k |

Estimated Integration Subtotal:
$400k – $1.1M

## 3. Total Installed Cost (10 MW Example)

Low-end deployment:
~$1.1M

High-end deployment:
~$2.8M

Most realistic mid-scale target:
$1.5M – $2.2M

---

## 4. Operating Savings (From Energy Modeling)

Using Moderate Scenario:

Cooling reduction: ~0.875 MW  
Annual savings: ~7.6M kWh  
Electricity rate: $0.08/kWh  

Annual cost savings:
~$613,000

Additional peak demand savings possible.

---

## 5. Simple Payback

If system cost = $1.8M  
Annual savings = $613k  

Simple Payback:

~2.9 years

If conservative savings ($367k/year):

~4.9 years

Still viable in most markets.

---

## 6. Long-Term Financial Value

10-year savings (moderate case):

$613k × 10 = $6.13M

Even after maintenance costs:

Net gain remains substantial.

---

## 7. Maintenance Profile

Vertical Radiator Tower:
- Low moving parts
- Pump + fan maintenance only
- Closed loop fluid management

Geothermal:
- Minimal wear
- No exposed components
- Long asset lifespan (20–50 years)

Mechanical chillers:
Reduced runtime extends lifespan.

## 8. Risk Profile

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Underperformance | Conservative design margins |
| Ground saturation | Hybrid tower sharing load |
| Permitting delay | Early municipal engagement |
| Upfront capital | ESG financing leverage |

---

## 9. ESG & Carbon Credits

Moderate case carbon reduction:

~3,000 metric tons CO₂ annually

Carbon pricing value (if applicable):
$20–$50 p
