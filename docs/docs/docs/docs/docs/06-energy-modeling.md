## 1. Purpose

This document models:

- Cooling load reduction
- Chiller displacement
- PUE improvement
- Annual kWh savings
- Carbon offset impact
- CAPEX vs ROI curves

Target facilities:

Mid-scale AI data centers  
5 MW – 20 MW IT load

---

## 2. Baseline Assumptions

Example Facility:

IT Load: 10 MW  
Cooling Overhead: 35%  
Total Facility Load ≈ 13.5 MW  
Baseline PUE: 1.35  

Cooling Electrical Demand ≈ 3.5 MW

Assume traditional mechanical chiller system.

## 3. Tower + Height-Assisted Cooling Impact

Assumptions:

- 60 ft effective head (building + tower)
- 10–15°F passive thermal drop achievable
- Hybrid radiator + ambient rejection
- Partial geothermal stabilization

Expected mechanical load reduction:

15% – 30% of cooling energy

---

## 4. Energy Offset Scenarios

### Scenario A – Conservative (15% reduction)

Cooling load = 3.5 MW  
Reduction = 0.525 MW  

Annual savings:

0.525 MW × 8760 hours =  
4,599,000 kWh

At $0.08/kWh:

$367,920/year

Carbon reduction (0.4 kg CO₂/kWh):

1,839,600 kg  
≈ 1,840 metric tons annually

---

### Scenario B – Moderate (25% reduction)

Cooling reduction = 0.875 MW  

Annual savings:

0.875 × 8760 =  
7,665,000 kWh

Annual cost savings:

$613,200

Carbon reduction:

3,066 metric tons annually

---

### Scenario C – Aggressive (35% reduction)

Cooling reduction = 1.225 MW  

Annual savings:

10,731,000 kWh

Annual cost savings:

$858,480

Carbon reduction:

4,292 metric tons annually

---

## 5. PUE Impact

Baseline PUE:

1.35

If 0.875 MW removed from cooling load:

New Facility Load:

13.5 – 0.875 = 12.625 MW

New PUE:

12.625 / 10 = 1.26

PUE improvement:

1.35 → 1.26

This is highly significant in competitive markets.

---

## 6. Multi-Site Scaling Impact

If deployed across:

10 data centers (10 MW each)

Annual carbon reduction (moderate scenario):

3,066 × 10 =  
30,660 metric tons CO₂ annually

Equivalent to:

~6,600 passenger vehicles removed per year

---

## 7. Pumping Energy Considerations

Gravity-assisted loop reduces pump demand.

If pump reduction:

100 kW continuous reduction

Annual savings:

876,000 kWh

Additional $70,000/year savings

Pump optimization adds measurable value.

---

## 8. CAPEX Rough Order of Magnitude

Vertical radiator towers:

$150k – $400k depending on scale

Geothermal borefield:

$400k – $750k

Plumbing + heat exchangers:

$250k – $500k

Total Hybrid System:

~$1M – $1.6M

---

## 9. ROI Estimation

Using Moderate Scenario:

Annual savings ≈ $613,200

If system cost = $1.2M

Simple payback:

~1.95 years

Even at conservative savings:

Payback under 4 years possible.

## 10. Strategic Value Beyond Energy

- ESG reporting improvement
- Grid stress reduction
- Resilience improvement
- Reduced peak demand penalties
- Carbon credit potential
- Differentiation for AI colocation clients

---

## 11. Competitive Positioning

This architecture competes with:

- Direct evaporative cooling
- Adiabatic towers
- Full geothermal
- Liquid immersion systems

Key differentiator:

Layered passive + mechanical hybrid system
Optimizes building height as a thermal asset.

---

## 12. Future Modeling Work

- Climate-specific modeling (ASHRAE zones)
- Hourly simulation (8760 modeling)
- AI rack density scenarios (40–100 kW/rack)
- Thermal inertia modeling
- Dynamic control system optimization
- Real-time adaptive valve modeling

---

## 13. Conclusion

This hybrid system:

- Reduces cooling energy 15–35%
- Improves PUE meaningfully
- Generates measurable carbon offset
- Has a realistic ROI window
- Scales across mid-size AI facilities

This is not speculative physics.

It is layered thermal engineering applied intelligently.
